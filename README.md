  Web Fundamentals 2

## Overview

This week, as well as building on our HTML and CSS skills, we will be focusing on what we make and why we make it. It sounds obvious, but user facing software should be built with the user in mind. What are they trying to do, how can you make that as easy as possible for them to achieve. Learning how to communicate information, design natural flowing interactions and having the technical skills bring your ideas to life will set you apart from a lot of junior developers who become so consumed with the technology they are using that they forget the purpose they are trying to serve. The world does not need more software, it needs more useful software.

So for this week our focus will be practicing and mastering as much of the basics as possible so that we have the freedom to implement our user centered designs.

### This Weeks Objectives

- Go deeper into HTML, CSS and using Git.
- Think about the user.
- Host our projects for the world to see!

## Learning Journey 🗺

### Checkpoint Challenge ✅

Your first checkpoint challenge is to make a website all about your partner. This site will be a profile representing your partner to the rest of the group. As we said on Saturday, you should work with your partner to find out all the information you need and how they think their profile should be. You should also use your own judgment as to what the rest of the cohort would find interesting.

Follow this link and accept the GitHub classroom assignment. This will create a repo within the School of Code organisation for you to use. This will help us check up on how everyone is doing!
